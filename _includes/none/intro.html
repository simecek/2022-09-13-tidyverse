This two-days introductory workshop focuses on boosting your data analysis and visualization expertise with R programming language.

The workshop is based on the R package Tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org/) and the R graphical user interface (GUI) RStudio (https://rstudio.com/). The tutors will guide you from loading your data in R, choosing a nice tidy data format, through data transformations, statistical modelling and cool visualizations, to communicating results in a reproducible report. We will proceed through a series of exercises. 

At the end of the workshop, you will master publication-ready visualizations with ggplot2, data transformations and summarizing with dplyr and tidyr, working with dates, character strings, untidy data formats, generating reproducible reports with R Markdown, reading data with fast readr functions, and iterate through them with purrr package.

The course is highly inspired by the Garrett Grolemundâ€™s course Master The Tidyverse. Due to space capacity, the workshop will be strictly limited to 20 participants. The course is offered for free. Every participant gets a collection of RStudio cheat-sheets.
  
  
Plan to attend both days of this course <strong>face-to-face on the JAX Bar Harbor campus</strong>.
